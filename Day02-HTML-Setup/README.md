# Day 02: What is HTML and Setting Up My Development Environment

**Date:** July 8, 2025

## 📚 Topic Covered:

- Definition and purpose of HTML (HyperText Markup Language).
- Basic HTML syntax: tags, elements, attributes.
- Setting up a basic HTML file structure (`<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`).
- Using VS Code for HTML development (extensions like Live Server).

## 📝 Key Learnings:

- HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages.
- It uses "tags" enclosed in angle brackets (`<>`) to define elements.
- Most tags come in pairs (opening and closing tags, e.g., `<p>...</p>`).
- Some tags are self-closing (e.g., `<br>`, `<img>`).
- Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.
- `<!DOCTYPE html>` declares the document type.
- `<head>` contains metadata, and `<body>` contains the visible content.
- Live Server extension in VS Code is incredibly useful for instantly seeing HTML changes.

## 💡 Task/Mini-Project:

- **Task:** Understood the fundamental role of HTML in web development.
- **Task:** Created the basic HTML boilerplate structure in `index.html`.
