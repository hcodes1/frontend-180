# Day 07: Anchor tags and linking between pages

**Date:** July 18, 2025

## üìö Topic Covered:

  * Anchor tags (`<a>`) for creating hyperlinks
  * `href` attribute for specifying link destinations
  * Linking to external websites (`target="_blank"`, `rel="noopener noreferrer"`)
  * Linking to internal pages (relative paths)
  * Linking to specific sections within the same page (anchor links)
  * Email contact links (`mailto:`)

## üìù Key Learnings:

  * The **anchor tag (`<a>`)** is the fundamental HTML element for creating hyperlinks, allowing users to navigate between web pages or to different sections within the same page.
  * The **`href` attribute** is essential for the `<a>` tag, as it specifies the URL or path that the hyperlink points to.
  * To open an external link in a **new browser tab**, the `target="_blank"` attribute is used.
  * When `target="_blank"` is used, it's a best practice and security measure to also include **`rel="noopener noreferrer"`**. `noopener` prevents the new page from accessing the original page's `window.opener` property, and `noreferrer` prevents the new page from knowing which page referred it.
  * **Internal links** use relative paths (e.g., `about.html` or `../images/pic.jpg`) to navigate within the same website, making the site structure more flexible.
  * **Anchor links** (e.g., `<a href="#section-id">`) allow users to jump to specific sections within the *same* HTML page. This requires the target element to have a matching `id` attribute (e.g., `<section id="section-id">`).
  * The `mailto:` protocol in the `href` attribute (e.g., `<a href="mailto:your.email@example.com">`) creates a link that, when clicked, opens the user's default email client pre-filled with the recipient's address.

## üí° Task/Mini-Project:

  * **Task:** Build a single HTML page that demonstrates various linking capabilities. This includes a navigation bar with internal links to different sections on the page, an external link that opens in a new tab (with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`), a "Back to top" anchor link, and an email contact link.

  * **Project:** Located in `Day07-Anchor-Tags-Linking/index.html`

      * This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of HTML linking. It shows how to navigate within a single page, link to external resources securely, and provide direct email contact, all using HTML.
