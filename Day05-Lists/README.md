# Day 05: HTML Lists - Ordered, Unordered, and Description Lists

**Date:** July 11, 2025

## üìö Topic Covered:

  * Unordered Lists (`<ul>` and `<li>`)
  * Ordered Lists (`<ol>` and `<li>`)
  * Description Lists (`<dl>`, `<dt>`, and `<dd>`)
  * Nesting Lists for complex structures

## üìù Key Learnings:

  * **Unordered lists** (`<ul>`) are used for items where the order doesn't matter (e.g., a shopping list). Each item is marked with a bullet point by default. List items are defined by `<li>` tags.
  * **Ordered lists** (`<ol>`) are for items where the sequence is important (e.g., steps in a recipe). Each item is numbered by default. Again, `<li>` tags define the list items.
  * **Description lists** (`<dl>`) are used for terms and their descriptions. Each term is defined by a `<dt>` (description term) tag, and its description by a `<dd>` (description detail) tag. This is great for glossaries or Q\&A sections.
  * All list types can be **nested** within each other. This means you can put an entire list inside an `<li>` or `dd` tag to create sub-lists, which is powerful for organizing hierarchical information.
  * Using the correct list type semantically helps with accessibility and makes your HTML more meaningful.

## üí° Task/Mini-Project:

  * **Task:** Create a web page featuring a "Daily Routine" and a "Glossary of HTML Terms." The daily routine will use an ordered list, and the glossary will use a description list. Incorporate at least one nested unordered list within your daily routine.

  * **Project:** Located in `Day05-Lists/lists-example.html`

      * This project showcases the practical application of ordered, unordered, and description lists to structure diverse content like steps and definitions. The inclusion of a nested list demonstrates how to manage hierarchical information effectively using HTML lists.
