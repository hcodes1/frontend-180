# Day 04: HTML Text Elements: Headings, Paragraphs, and Dividers

**Date:** July 11, 2025

## üìö Topic Covered:

  * HTML Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)
  * HTML Paragraphs (`<p>`)
  * Line Breaks (`<br>`) and Horizontal Rules (`<hr>`)
  * Semantic vs. Presentational Use of Text Elements

## üìù Key Learnings:

  * **Headings** (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) define the hierarchy and structure of content. `<h1>` is the most important (main title, usually one per page), and the numbers decrease in importance. They're crucial for SEO and accessibility.
  * **Paragraphs** (`<p>`) are used for blocks of text. Browsers automatically add vertical spacing around them, making content more readable.
  * **Line Breaks** (`<br>`) force a new line *within* a block of text, like in an address or a poem. It's an empty tag and should not be used for spacing between different blocks.
  * **Horizontal Rules** (`<hr>`) represent a thematic break or change in topic within the content, visually often appearing as a horizontal line. It's also an empty tag.
  * A key insight is always to use these tags for their **semantic meaning** (what the content *is*) rather than just for their default visual appearance (what it *looks like*). Styling should be handled with CSS.

## üí° Task/Mini-Project:

  * **Task:** Create a simple "About Me" page that effectively utilizes headings to structure personal information, paragraphs for descriptions, and incorporates line breaks for formatting details, along with horizontal rules for thematic separation.

  * **Project:** Located in `Day04-Text-Elements/text-formating.html`

      * This project demonstrates how these core HTML text elements work together to build a well-structured, readable, and semantically correct web page without any styling. It includes sections for professional background, hobbies, and contact information.
